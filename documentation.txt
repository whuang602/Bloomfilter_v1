Documentations:

A list is used in the hash table because a list is a dynamic
data structure that not only allows multiple values to be
stored at one specific index but it also represents a hash 
table with separate chaining extremely well. Access of a specific
bucket is easy and intuitive and insertion/removal/find are all
extremely efficient and easy.

A list is used in the bloomFilter because it allows the user
to change the size of the data structure post declaration,
which is extremely convenient. I initially wanted to simply
use an array, which would normally be sufficient, but an
array requires that the size of the data structure be decided
upon declaration, which was not possible.
